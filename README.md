# Welcome to Fuel App!

The Fuel-App is a fuel price research application based on sefaz's API and its main objective is to help consumers fill their vehicle with the cheapest fuel.
For this project I am using Ionic with mapBox integration.


# Framework and Library

In this project I used Ionic in version 9.1.6 with nodeJs version v12.18.2, for integration with the map, I used the [mapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
